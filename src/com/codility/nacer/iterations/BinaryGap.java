/**
 * Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.
 * <p>
 * A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at
 * both ends in the binary representation of N.
 * <p>
 * For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has
 * binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number 20
 * has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1. The number 15 has binary representation
 * 1111 and has no binary gaps. The number 32 has binary representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public int solution(int N); }
 * <p>
 * that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N
 * doesn't contain a binary gap.
 * <p>
 * For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its
 * longest binary gap is of length 5. Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation
 * '100000' and thus no binary gaps.
 * <p>
 * Assume that:
 * <p>
 * N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
 * Complexity:
 * <p>
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(N));
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
