/**
 * Find the maximum number of flags that can be set on mountain peaks.
 * <p>
 * A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
 * <p>
 * A peak is an array element which is larger than its neighbours. More precisely, it is an index P such that
 * 0 < P < N − 1 and A[P − 1] < A[P] > A[P + 1].
 * <p>
 * For example, the following array A:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 1
 * A[1] = 5
 * A[2] = 3
 * A[3] = 4
 * A[4] = 3
 * A[5] = 4
 * A[6] = 1
 * A[7] = 2
 * A[8] = 3
 * A[9] = 4
 * A[10] = 6
 * A[11] = 2
 * has exactly four peaks: elements 1, 3, 5 and 10.
 * <p>
 * You are going on a trip to a range of mountains whose relative heights are represented by array A, as shown in a
 * figure below. You have to choose how many flags you should take with you. The goal is to set the maximum number of
 * flags on the peaks, according to certain rules.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Flags can only be set on peaks. What's more, if you take K flags, then the distance between any two flags should be
 * greater than or equal to K. The distance between indices P and Q is the absolute value |P − Q|.
 * <p>
 * For example, given the mountain range represented by array A, above, with N = 12, if you take:
 * <p>
 * two flags, you can set them on peaks 1 and 5;
 * three flags, you can set them on peaks 1, 5 and 10;
 * four flags, you can set only three flags, on peaks 1, 5 and 10.
 * You can therefore set a maximum of three flags in this case.
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
 * <p>
 * that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of flags that can be set on the peaks of
 * the array.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following array A:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 1
 * A[1] = 5
 * A[2] = 3
 * A[3] = 4
 * A[4] = 3
 * A[5] = 4
 * A[6] = 1
 * A[7] = 2
 * A[8] = 3
 * A[9] = 4
 * A[10] = 6
 * A[11] = 2
 * the function should return 3, as explained above.
 * <p>
 * Assume that:
 * <p>
 * N is an integer within the range [1..400,000];
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000].
 * Complexity:
 * <p>
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
